e) / = mathematical operator for division
f) + = mathematical operator for addition
g) 6 = integer value

			Ques.no.2.Ans
The differnce between string and variables are given in below points:
1) String are one of the data types which are used to represent the alphabetic values which are present in between of 
single or double quotes. In other hand, variables are the place where we store our data and that data might be of
any type
2)String can be still display by print function even we did not assign it to the variables but if we try to print the variables without 
without storing any value  then it will print the null values.
3)String will not remain last forever if it does not declare inside the variables so variables are used to keep the record of data
through out the program . So string value relie on varaibels to get store and reuse the same kind of value further more in entire 
program
4)There is no any certain convention for the string data type if it define in between of quotes but to decalre varibales we shuould
folloe certain convention like never start variable name with number and try to avoid to use sign, symbol and never begin your 
variable first letter with capital becasuse it will could casue error
4)Exmaple of String : "Hello World". Exmaple of Variabels :  display_output = "Hello World"

			Ques.no.3.Ans
The three different data types are:
1)integer
	Integer are the one of the data type in python which will contain only the non decimal valeus like 1,2,3,4,5 etc. 
We use integer values for the mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. Python is dynamically 
typed langauge so we don't need to declare varaible type like int a = 2, so we can decalre it just by a = 2.
2) float
	Float are one of the data type in python which will contain the decimal values like 1.1,2.5 etc. Flot are just like
the integer but in here we also count the number that come after the decimal values. We also use float to do verious mathematical
calculations.
3) boolean 
	boolean are one of the data type in python which will represnt true and false value. The value that we obtain from boolean 
data type will come from the execution of certain conditon provide by the programmer. We can store the boolean values in variabels
also. Eg: is_true = True

			Ques.no.4.Ans
Expression are made up of by following ways:
a) a+b 
b) (2*5)+3 
c) "*" * 3

As we know that expression are the piece of code that produced a value so all the expression which we write in our program to 
evalute some result after successfully execution of expression.

			Ques.no.5.Ans
The defference between expression and statment are listed below in points:
1) from the example spam = 10. In where we can see that spam and 10 are the expression and when both spam and 10 come togther 
like spam = 10 than it is a statement.
2)An expression is any word or group of words or symbols that is a value but statment is a group of 
expressions and/or statements that you design to carry out a task or an action


			Ques.no.6.Ans
The variable bacon will contain 23 value in it.

			Ques.no.7.Ans
1) The value of 'spam' + 'spamspam' will give us the string value result which is spamspamspam i.e 'spam' + 'spamspam' => spamspamspam

			Ques.no.8.Ans
Egg is valid varaible name because variable name begin with the english alaphabet word like a,b,c,d etc. But 100 is not valid
variable name because 100 begin with the numeric value which is the bad way to declare the varibale.

			Ques.no.9.Ans
We can use int() function to get the integer value , float() function to get the float value and str() function to ger the string 
value.

			Ques.no.10.Ans
We cannot concatenate string type to integer type because it create the TypeError condition. So in order to avoid these case 
we should use str() function in order print integer as a string.
	print("I have eaten "+ str(55) +" burritos")
