        "Ans: the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions is that both are used to define functions, but they differ in syntax, function naming, complexity, and the way they handle return values. def statements are used for more complex functions with a dedicated name, while lambda expressions are used for small, anonymous functions where brevity is important."

They allow you to specify the expected types of the arguments and the return type of a function. Function annotations are optional and do not affect the runtime behavior of the function. They serve as a form of documentation and can be accessed through the function's __annotations__ attribute.\n",

Recursive functions typically have two components: a base case that defines the simplest version of the problem and the recursive case that breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.\n",
