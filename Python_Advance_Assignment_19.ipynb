        "\n",
        "Ans: The relationship between a class and its instances in object-oriented programming (OOP) is typically a one-to-many relationship, also known as a one-to-N relationship. This means that a single class definition can be used to create multiple instances (objects) of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - To clarify:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that all instances of the class will have. The class itself is not an object but rather a description of how objects should be created.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Instance: An instance, also known as an object, is a specific realization or occurrence of a class. Each instance of a class has its own unique set of attribute values but shares the same structure and behavior defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In this one-to-many relationship:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - One class definition can be used to create multiple instances of that class.\n",
        "    - Each instance is independent and encapsulates its own state (attribute values) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "    - Changes made to one instance generally do not affect other instances of the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This relationship allows for code reusability, as the class serves as a template for creating multiple instances with similar characteristics and behaviors. Additionally, it enables modular and organized code design, as related functionality can be grouped together within a single class definition"

These are attributes that are unique to each individual instance of the class. Instance-specific data is stored within the instance itself and can have different values for each instance."

The use of self is a convention in Python, though it is not a reserved keyword, and you can technically use any name you like for this parameter. However, using self is a widely adopted convention and helps improve code readability and maintainability.\n",

        "\n",

        "Ans: In programming, reflection refers to the ability of a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. Reflection methods are used to introspect objects, classes, modules, or types in a program, and they enable dynamic inspection and manipulation of their attributes, methods, and other properties.\n",

They are useful in scenarios where the program needs to adapt to changing conditions, support dynamic behavior, or enable metaprogramming. However, their use should be balanced with considerations of performance, readability, and maintainability. In many cases, explicit programming techniques may be preferred over reflection methods when the structure and behavior are known or can be statically configured."
