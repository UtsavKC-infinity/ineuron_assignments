        "Ans:  PyInputPlus is not part of the Python Standard Library. It is an additional third-party library that provides extended input validation and handling capabilities for user input in Python programs. PyInputPlus simplifies the process of getting input from users and provides features like automatic conversion of input to specific data types, input validation, and retry prompts."

If the user enters a non-integer value, or if the entered value cannot be converted to an integer, inputInt() will reprompt the user until a valid integer is provided. It returns the validated integer value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)inputFloat(): This function is used to obtain input from the user and ensure that the input is a floating-point number. Similar to inputInt(), if the user enters a non-float value or an input that cannot be converted to a float, inputFloat() will continue to reprompt the user until a valid float is provided. It returns the validated float value.\n"
