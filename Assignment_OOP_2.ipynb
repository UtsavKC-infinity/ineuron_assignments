Modules can contain classes, and classes can be exported from modules for reuse in other parts of the code. By leveraging both classes and modules, you can achieve modular and reusable code structures in your Python programs."

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data (attributes) and functionality (methods) related to a specific concept or entity. It defines the structure and behavior of objects that will be created from it. By understanding classes, you can grasp how objects are created, how to access their attributes and methods, and how to define your own classes to model real-world or abstract concepts.\n",

An object encapsulates both data and behavior associated with that specific instance. Understanding how objects are created, how they store and manipulate data through attributes, and how they perform actions through methods is crucial to comprehending OOP code. It involves understanding concepts such as instantiation, instance variables, and method invocation.\n",
