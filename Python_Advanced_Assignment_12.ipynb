        "\n",
        "While strings themselves are immutable in Python, the += operator can be used to concatenate strings in a way that appears to modify the original string, but it actually creates a new string object and rebinds the variable to reference the new string.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "In Python, there is typically only one way to index a character from a string, which is by using square brackets [] notation with the index of the character you want to access. However, there are a few variations and techniques related to indexing characters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Positive Indexing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Characters in a string can be indexed using positive integers, starting from 0 for the first character, 1 for the second character, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "         my_string = \"hello\"\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Negative Indexing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python allows negative indexing, where characters can be accessed relative to the end of the string, with -1 representing the last character, -2 representing the second-to-last character, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        my_string = \"hello\"\n",

        "3. Slicing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Slicing allows you to access a range of characters from a string by specifying start and end indices separated by a colon : inside square brackets.\n",
        "Slicing returns a substring containing characters from the start index up to (but not including) the end index.\n",

        "  \n",
        "4. Extended Slice Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python's extended slice syntax allows for more flexibility when slicing strings, allowing you to specify a step value along with start and end indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "      my_string = \"hello\"\n",
