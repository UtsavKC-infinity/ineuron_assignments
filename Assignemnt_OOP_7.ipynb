        "Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The purpose of the try statement in Python is to define a block of code that may potentially raise an exception. The try block allows you to encapsulate code that might cause errors or exceptions and provides a structured way to handle those exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goal of the try statement is to protect the execution of code that could potentially raise exceptions and provide a mechanism to gracefully handle those exceptions, preventing the program from abruptly terminating or crashing. By enclosing the risky code within a try block, you can anticipate and handle potential exceptions that may occur during its execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The two most popular variations of the try statement in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)try-except\n",
        "\n",
        "2)try-finally\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "The raise statement in Python is used to explicitly raise an exception during the execution of a program. It allows you to indicate that a specific exceptional condition has occurred and control the flow of your code accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the raise statement is to signal exceptional situations, errors, or conditions that require special handling. By raising an exception, you can interrupt the normal flow of execution and transfer control to an exception handler or propagate the exception up the call stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "The assert statement in Python is used to assert or validate that a certain condition is true. It is primarily used for debugging and testing purposes to catch and verify assumptions during development.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assert statement takes a condition as its argument and evaluates it. If the condition is True, the program continues executing without any interruption. However, if the condition is False, an AssertionError exception is raised, indicating that the assumed condition has failed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assert statement is similar to the if statement in that both evaluate a condition and take actions based on the result. However, the key difference is that the assert statement is primarily used for debugging and testing, while the if statement is used for general conditional branching and control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The with/as statement in Python is used for resource management, specifically when working with objects that need to be properly initialized and cleaned up. It provides a convenient and concise way to handle the acquisition and release of resources in a clean and automatic manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the with/as statement is to ensure that a particular block of code has exclusive access to a resource and that the resource is properly released or cleaned up when the block of code is exited, even if exceptions occur within the block.\n",
        "\n",
        "The with/as statement is similar in purpose to the try/finally statement. Both are used for resource management and ensure cleanup or finalization actions. However, the with/as statement provides a more concise and readable syntax by encapsulating the acquisition and release of resources within a single statement.\n",
