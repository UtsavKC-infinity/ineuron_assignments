        "Raw strings are often used in Regex objects because they treat backslashes (\\) as literal characters rather than escape characters. Regular expressions often contain many backslashes, which are used to specify special characters or sequences. By using raw strings (prefixing the string with r), backslashes are not treated as escape characters, simplifying the representation of regular expressions and avoiding the need for excessive escaping."
